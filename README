Welcome to simple inventory system with Spring Web MVC and Spring.

*********************************************************************************************************************
Introduction

This is a a very basic inventory management system. 

I am using this tutorial for learning the specifics of Spring framework and developing an application with it.

Technologies used include Java, Spring, JSP, HTML, HSQLDB. The development environment is Eclipse IDE for Java EE 
developers, Ant 1.8.3 for making the build and deployment and Apache Tomcat is the application server.

The springapp folder contains the project demo including all the resources. 

Note that the current installation of the invetory system is on my local machine. Therefore changes have to be done to 
make it run on another machine. 

My current effort is to create different applications based on the program example.
